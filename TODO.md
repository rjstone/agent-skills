# TODO

## Formats

- [ ] Claude Code plugin: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (+ `marketplace.json`)
      pointing at `skills/`; the skills CLI also reads these manifests.
- [ ] Claude desktop/web plugin (zip upload).
- [ ] opencode v2 plugin (and v1, if still worth it).
- [ ] Versioning, once a format with a version field exists.

## Skills

- [ ] `opencode-console`: on hold (the user, 2026-11-08). Checked 2026-11-08:
      the Console docs have no API for reading or writing Go/Zen account data
      (usage, balance, billing and budgets are web-UI only; usage export is a
      CSV button). They document only the inference endpoints
      (`https://opencode.ai/inference/...`), the model lists
      (`GET /inference/v1/models`, `/inference/go/v1/models`), API key types
      and SCIM user sync. Revisit if an account API appears.
- [ ] Docs-cache skills copy their refresh script (each skill must stand
      alone when installed). If they drift, generate the copies from one
      template instead of hand-editing each.
- [ ] `opencode-build` `ERRATA.md`: record the doc mistakes already seen
      (verify each against the installed `@opencode/plugin` types).

## Automation

- [ ] Scheduled workflow: run each skill's `refresh_references.py` weekly and
      open a PR when the docs changed.

## Consumers

- [ ] The project where `opencode-build` started: decide how it uses the
      skill (install with `npx skills` vs keep a vendored copy), then remove
      or sync its own copy.
